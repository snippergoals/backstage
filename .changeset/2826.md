The InfoCard variant `'height100'` is deprecated. Use variant `'gridItem'` instead.

When the InfoCard is displayed as a grid item within a grid, you may want items to have the same height for all items.
Set to the `'gridItem'` variant to display the InfoCard with full height suitable for Grid:
`<InfoCard variant="gridItem">...</InfoCard>`

Changed the InfoCards in '@backstage/plugin-github-actions', '@backstage/plugin-jenkins', '@backstage/plugin-lighthouse'
to pass an optional variant to the corresponding card of the plugin.

As a result the overview content of the EntityPage shows cards with full height suitable for Grid.
