Filters passed to the `/entities` endpoint of the catalog has changed format.

The old way was to pass things on the form `?a=b&c=d`; the new way is to pass
things on the form `?filter=a=b,c=d`. See discussion in
[#2910](https://github.com/spotify/backstage/issues/2910) for details.

The comma separated items within a single filter have an AND between them. If
multiple such filters are passed, they have an OR between those item groups.
