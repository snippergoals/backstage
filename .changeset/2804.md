Limit the http headers that are forwarded from the request to a safe set of defaults.
A user can configure additional headers that should be forwarded if the specific applications needs that.

```yaml
proxy:
  '/my-api':
    target: 'https://my-api.com/get'
    allowedHeaders:
      # We need to forward the Authorization header that was provided by the caller
      - Authorization
```
