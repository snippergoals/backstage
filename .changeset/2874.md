The way that wiring together a catalog happens, has changed drastically. Now
there is a new class `CatalogBuilder` that does almost all of the heavy lifting
of how to augment/replace pieces of catalog functionality, such as adding
support for custom entities or adding additional processors.

As the builder was added, a lot of the static methods and builders for default
setups have been removed from classes deep in the hierarchy. Instead, the
builder contains the knowledge of what the defaults are.
