Remove the backstage.io/definition-at-location annotation.
The annotation was superseded by the placeholder processor.

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: API
metadata:
  name: spotify
  description: The Spotify web API
  tags:
    - spotify
    - rest
  annotations:
    # Don't use this annotation, but the placeholder $text instead (see below).
    backstage.io/definition-at-location: 'url:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/master/APIs/spotify.com/v1/swagger.yaml'
spec:
  type: openapi
  lifecycle: production
  owner: spotify@example.com
  definition:
    $text: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/master/APIs/spotify.com/v1/swagger.yaml
```
