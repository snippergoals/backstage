'@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend': patch
---

An entity A, that exists in the catalog, can no longer be overwritten by registering a different location that also tries to supply an entity with the same kind+namespace+name. Writes of that new entity will instead be rejected with a log message similar to `Rejecting write of entity Component:default/artist-lookup from file:/Users/freben/dev/github/backstage/packages/catalog-model/examples/components/artist-lookup-component.yaml because entity existed from github:https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/examples/components/artist-lookup-component.yaml`
