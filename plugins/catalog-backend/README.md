# Catalog Backend

WORK IN PROGRESS

This is the backend part of the default catalog plugin.

It responds to requests from the frontend part, and fulfills them by delegating
to your existing catalog related services.

## Getting Started

After starting the backend, you can issue the `yarn mock-catalog-data` command
in this directory to populate the catalog with some mock entities.
