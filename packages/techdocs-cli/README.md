# TechDocs CLI

Check out the [TechDocs README](https://github.com/spotify/backstage/blob/master/plugins/techdocs/README.md) to learn more.

**WIP: This cli is a work in progress. It is not ready for use yet. Follow our progress on [the Backstage Discord](https://discord.gg/MUpMjP2) under #docs-like-code or on [our GitHub Milestone](https://github.com/spotify/backstage/milestone/15).**

## Getting Started

You'll need Docker installed and running to use this. You will also need to build the container located at `plugins/techdocs/mkdocs/container` under the tag `mkdocs:local-dev`, as you can see in the commands from below:

```bash
docker build plugins/techdocs/mkdocs/container -t mkdocs:local-dev
```

From that point, you can invoke the CLI from any project with a docs folder. Try out our example!

```bash
cd plugins/techdocs/mkdocs/mock-docs
npx @techdocs/cli serve
```

## Local Development

You'll need Docker installed and running to use this. You will also need to build the container located at `plugins/techdocs/mkdocs/container` under the tag `mkdocs:local-dev`, as you can see in the commands from below:

```bash
docker build plugins/techdocs/mkdocs/container -t mkdocs:local-dev
```

Once that is built, you'll need to manually create an `alias` for running the CLI locally:

```bash
cd packages/techdocs-cli
echo "$(pwd)/bin/techdocs"

# Copy the value from above and add it in [HERE] below
# For more convenience, add it to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile
# otherwise you'll lose it when you open a new Terminal
alias techdocs="[HERE]"
```

From that point, you can invoke `techdocs` from any project with a docs folder. Try out our example!

```bash
cd plugins/techdocs/mkdocs/mock-docs
techdocs serve
```

You should have a `localhost:3000` serving TechDocs in Backstage, as well as `localhost:8000` serving Mkdocs (which won't open up and be exposed to the user).

Happy hacking!
