# Example Entities

NOTE: These are being replaced with the contents of the `examples-relative`
sibling directory, after December 16 2020. If you are using this example data
you will need to be using a released version of the catalog backend which
supports relative targets in Location entities
[see #3513](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/3513) after that time.
