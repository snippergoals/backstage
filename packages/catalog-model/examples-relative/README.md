# Examples with relative paths

These examples use Location entities with relative paths
[see #3513](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/3513).

The `examples` sibling directory will be replaced with these contents no sooner
than December 16 2020, to give consumers time to adopt the above change.

The contents of this directory is here for consumers who are on the edge and
want to use the new facility before December 16.
