 * The feature flags API is used to toggle functionality to users across plugins and Backstage.
 *
 * Plugins can use this API to register feature flags that they have available
 * for users to enable/disable, and this API will centralize the current user's
 * state of which feature flags they would like to enable.
 *
 * This is ideal for Backstage plugins, as well as your own App, to trial incomplete
 * or unstable upcoming features. Although there will be a common interface for users
 * to enable and disable feature flags, this API acts as another way to enable/disable.
