# example-backend

This package is an EXAMPLE of a Backstage backend.

The main purpose of this package is to provide a test bed for Backstage plugins
that have a backend part. Feel free to experiment locally or within your fork
by adding dependencies and routes to this backend, to try things out.

Our goal is to eventually amend the create-app flow of the CLI, such that a
production ready version of a backend skeleton is made alongside the frontend
app. Until then, feel free to experiment here!

## Development

To run the backend in watch mode, use `yarn start`.
