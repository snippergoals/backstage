## Current status

Backstage is currently in Alpha. This means that you can expect APIs and
features to change until we reach our
[Backstage Beta milestone](https://github.com/spotify/backstage/milestone/19).
Before we have API stability, plugins will need ongoing maintenance. It is also
recommended that teams who adopt Backstage today upgrades their installation as
new [releases](https://github.com/spotify/backstage/releases) are available.

## Phases

We have divided the project into three high-level _phases_ and we have already
begun work on various aspects of these phases:

- üê£ **Phase 1:** Extensible frontend platform (Done ‚úÖ) - You will be able to
  easily create a single consistent UI layer for your internal infrastructure
  and tools. A set of reusable
  [UX patterns and components](https://backstage.io/storybook) help ensure a
  consistent experience between tools.

- üê¢ **Phase 2:** Service Catalog
  ([alpha released](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha)) -
  With a single catalog, Backstage makes it easy for a team to manage ten
  services ‚Äî and makes it possible for your company to manage thousands of them.

- üêá **Phase 3:** Ecosystem (later) - Everyone's infrastructure stack is
  different. By fostering a vibrant community of contributors we hope to provide
  an ecosystem of Open Source plugins/integrations that allows you to pick the
  tools that match your stack.
