description: Roadmap of Backstage Project
---

## Current status

> Backstage is currently under rapid development. This means that you can expect
> APIs and features to evolve. It is also recommended that teams who adopt
> Backstage today upgrade their installation as new
> [releases](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases) become available,
> as Backwards compatibility is not yet guaranteed.

## Phases

We have divided the project into three high-level _phases_:

- üê£ **Phase 1:** Extensible frontend platform (Done ‚úÖ) - You will be able to
  easily create a single consistent UI layer for your internal infrastructure
  and tools. A set of reusable
  [UX patterns and components](https://backstage.io/storybook) help ensure a
  consistent experience between tools.

- üê¢ **Phase 2:** Service Catalog
  ([alpha released](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha)) -
  With a single catalog, Backstage makes it easy for a team to manage ten
  services ‚Äî and makes it possible for your company to manage thousands of them.

- üêá **Phase 3:** Ecosystem (ongoing, see
  [Plugin Marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins)) - Everyone's
  infrastructure stack is different. By fostering a vibrant community of
  contributors we hope to provide an ecosystem of Open Source
  plugins/integrations that allows you to pick the tools that match your stack.

## Detailed roadmap

guidelines to get started.

### Ongoing work üöß

- **[Plugins for managing micro services end-2-end](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/14)**
  Out of the box Backstage will ship with a set of plugins (Overview, CI, API
  and Docs) that will demonstrate how a user can manage a micro service and
  follow a change all the way out in production. Completing this work will make
  it much easier to see how a plugin can be built that integrates with the
  Backstage Service Catalog.

- **[Users and teams](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/1807)**
  Ownership is a central concept in Backstage. It should be easy to import your
  existing organizational data, such as users and groups/teams, into Backstage.
  A user the logs into Backstage should see software components owned by the
  team(s) they are in.

- **[Backstage platform is stable](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/19)** -
  The platform APIs and features are stable and can be depended on for
  production use. After this plugins will require little to no maintenance.

* **[Improved Kubernetes plugin](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/2857)** -
  Native support for Kubernetes, making it easier for developers to see and
  manage their services running in k8s.

- Further improvements to platform documentation. Examples include a Golden Path
  for plugin development.

### Future work üîÆ

- **Deploy a product demo at `demo.backstage.io`** - Deploy a typical Backstage
  deployment available publicly so that people can click around and get a feel
  for the product without having to install anything.

- **[Global search](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/1499)** -
  Extend the basic search available in the Backstage Service Catalog with a
  global search experience. Long term this search solution should be extensible,
  making it possible for you add custom search results.

- **[[TechDocs V.2] Stabilization release](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/17)** -
  Platform stability and compatibility improvements.

- **Additional auth providers** - Backstage should work for most (all!) auth
  solutions. Since Backstage can be used by companies regardless of what cloud
  (or on prem) you are using we are especially keen to get auth support for
  [AWS](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/290),
  [Azure](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/348) and others.

- **[Initial GraphQL API](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/13)** -
  A GraphQL API will open up the rich metadata provided by Backstage in a single
  query. Plugins can easily query this API as well as extend the model where
  needed.

### Plugins

Building and maintaining [plugins](https://backstage.io/plugins) is the work of
the entire Backstage community.

A list of plugins that are in development is
[available here](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aplugin+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).
We strongly recommend to upvote üëç plugins you are interested in. This helps us
and the community prioritize what plugins to build.

Are you missing a plugin for your favorite tool? Please
[suggest a new one](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/new?labels=plugin&template=plugin_template.md&title=%5BPlugin%5D+THE+PLUGIN+NAME).
Chances are that someone will jump in and help build it.
