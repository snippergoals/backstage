## Deploying Locally

### Try on Docker

Run the following commands if you have Docker environment

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn docker-build
$ docker run --rm -it -p 7000:7000 -e APP_ENV=production -e NODE_ENV=development example-backend:latest
```

Then open http://localhost/ on your browser.

## Heroku

Deploying to Heroku is relatively easy following these steps.

First, make sure you have the
[Heroku CLI installed](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and log
into it as well as login into Heroku's
[container registry](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime).

```bash
$ heroku login
$ heroku container:login
```

You _might_ also need to set your Heroku app's stack to `container`.

```bash
$ heroku stack:set container -a <your-app>
```

We can now build/push the Docker image to Heroku's container registry and
release it to the `web` worker.

```bash
$ heroku container:push web -a <your-app>
$ heroku container:release web -a <your-app>
```

With that, you should have Backstage up and running!
