# Run an instance of Backstage

Open a terminal window and start the web app using the following commands from the project root:

```bash
$ yarn # may take a while

$ yarn start
```

The final `yarn start` command should open a local instance of Backstage in your browser, otherwise open one of the URLs printed in the terminal.
