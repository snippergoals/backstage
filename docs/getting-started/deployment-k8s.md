Backstage itself provides tooling up to the point of building Docker images.
Beyond that point we do not have an opinionated way to deploy Backstage within
Kubernetes, as each cluster has its own unique set of tooling and patterns.

We do provide examples to help you get started though. Check out
[this example](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/contrib/kubernetes/plain_single_backend_deployment/)
for a basic single-deployment setup.
